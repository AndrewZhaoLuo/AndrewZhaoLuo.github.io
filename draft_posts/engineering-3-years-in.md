## Reflections After 3 Years of Software Engineering

Three years ago I graduated with engineering degrees and set out to the wide world of software engineering. Along the way I've worked on interesting products, using interesting technologies, with interesting people. In this post, I reflect on some interesting topics which I think are pretty neat.

#### On the Importance of Iteration
I was originally going to title this "On the Importance of Working Quickly," but I realized later on that this 
didn't really capture what I wanted to say. Iterating, that is to say, trying new things, *reflecting*, and *_learning_* from your experiences is often the only real way to learn anything in software engineering. Working quickly is important in all of this since
it let's you accomplish more cycles of iteration if you are able to maintain the quality of the process. We don't want to be shotgunning things quickly without putting appropriate effort and process into the whole reflecting and learning part of things.

I think in this regard I am a bit blessed. On one hand, I am a perfectionist and completionist who likes understanding every little detail about the system I am working on so I can eventually run a precise simulation in my head. On the other hand, I am generally impatient and like seeing progress being made (I blame the instant-gratification of the internet). Therefore, when starting a new project or field of study, I am often initially immobilized with decision paralysis as I read background material and navel-gaze, before becoming restless and finally shotgunning some of the ideas in my head. I don't know what it sounds like to you, but the process is traditionally itself is haphazard and undisciplined. Some of my friends and colleagues can take a complicated project or idea and immediately start listing out ideas which they steadily weight the pros and cons of, narrowing things down with army-like precision.

But even if parts of my traditional approach to problem solving are deficient, I like to think it ends up ok most of the time because I tend to work very quickly, and I tend to be curious about my failures. Going back to the whole iteration process, I tend to learn things quickly. Whereas a colleague will know design choice A will probably lead to B due to some well reasoned thought process, I tried A (kind-of sort-of) and can confirm it will probably lead to B. Is this process scalable to every little thing that can come up? Can experience trump generalized learning? Probably not, but I like to think I'm also learning more general things in the process.

I would like to take this moment to thank all the safety-nets I had on hand which stopped me from doing stupid things. It's easy to iterate fast when you have great colleagues and test-suites to help steer you in the right direction. Pour one out:

### On Authorial Intent
I think hearing about design choices and trade-offs are one of the most interesting aspects in engineering. Learning about the various tricks and principles that makes a system work is often inspiring. For example, don't get to realize what "the bar" is in engineering is until you dive deep into how cheap rice-cookers are designed. Relevant Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSTNhvDGbYI). More improtantly, I like to think it helps build some empathy to the entire engineering process. 

- Understanding why things are done can help
  - Interact and talk with the original creators
  - Foresee future problems 
  - Keeps you humble since things are done for a reason
  - But sometimes, things are poorly designed

#### On Human Imperfection 
- Human error is like 90% of CS
- Capabilites vs Ease of use 
  - We have the capabiulity to do so much
- Not just user errors
  - people tend to do the easy thing
  - knowledge is a big thing as is visibility
  - make it hard to do the wrong thing
- Makes engineering funner
